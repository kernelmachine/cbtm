Now there was never any indicator whether not to ever play a game with the card inserted in the system, but if you did, it always froze randomly before a loading point. Have that happen enough times and the card stops working, period. Kaput. Dead. Another one was purchased with the exact same result, and stopped working even sooner.InterAct's products were something to be weary of back then, and even now. This is one of them.
