Crippled by disease, the child ponders the small beauties of life that offset her plight. Marianna's reflections may provide a valuable guide to those who face similiar trials in any age, showing a new way of measuring strength. However, the rambling quality will be off putting to many.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer. It is", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"], "prompt": " It is"}
