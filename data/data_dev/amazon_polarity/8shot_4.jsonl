[SEP] content: I have never written a review for a book before and have read a few hundred books over the last few years. This by far is the worst novels ever put in print and deserves to be outed. I am not even sure that the publisher should not be punished for allowing this to go to market. There is no real story and Jason plays almost no part in this book.

The book reads too much like a synopsis of a legal library. When statistics is discussed, it is an elementary exposition of basic concepts. What I wanted was lucid examples of how these basic concepts actually made a difference in legal cases. I did not get that from this book.

The book reads too much like a synopsis of a legal library. When statistics is discussed, it is an elementary exposition of basic concepts. What I wanted was lucid examples of how these basic concepts actually made a difference in legal cases. I did not get that from this book. This was the first book on statistics and law that I bought and read, so I don't know how to compare it to others. But I will select and try another to see if what I am looking for is out there.

{"task": "amazon_polarity", "input": "title: Feminist propaganda that goes nowhere [SEP] content: Once again, too bad zero ratings aren't allowed.This movie is just another piece of feminist propaganda from the late 1970s that regurgitates the usual anti-male spiel and has nothing of any substance to offer. The fact that the \"heroine\" sort of wanders off the screen at the end is most telling. She has her \"individuality\" and that's about it. George Harrison's song \"I Me Mine\" should have been playing in the background at that point.Blecch. It is negative\n\ntitle: Corelle Apricot Grove 16 pc Set [SEP] content: This was a Christmas gift. We are very displeased with this set, almost returned it. The dinner and desert plates are Corelle Apricot Grove, the coffee mugs are STONEWARE and the bowls are Corelle, but of a totally different pattern. Yes, the product description does say that, but I'm used to searching for a product and getting an exact match. I could of, and SHOULD HAVE gone to WalMart and purchased itthere for $10 less. It is negative\n\ntitle: good for kids, I guess [SEP] content: The music is way too \"synthy\" for me. In many cases the \"band\" sounds like a synthesizer and a drum box. Many of the lyrics are inane. Lou's voice seems ok. My 8 year old likes it a lot.The songs have a certain pop catchiness to them, but there just isn't much depth there. I have a hard time believing that this is the king of mambo. I certeinly wish that I was as studly as he is. It is negative\n\ntitle: Few words to describe how bad... [SEP] content: I have never written a review for a book before and have read a few hundred books over the last few years. This by far is the worst novels ever put in print and deserves to be outed. I am not even sure that the publisher should not be punished for allowing this to go to market. There is no real story and Jason plays almost no part in this book. It is almost as if the writer took out a thesaurus and scrambled the most complicated words and \"created\" a book. I could not even begin to explain any portion of the several senseless ramblings of stories that make up this book. It is negative\n\ntitle: costly but worth it [SEP] content: I long quit listening with my SR-60s because of the pad discomfort. Now they are so old the pads were turning brown anyway, so I looked into replacements. With a little bending up of the head-piece, these L-CUSH's fit great, and I can listen to excellent sound without being tortured by the way they feel on my head. The price seemed a little excessive, but after all this time it is like getting a new pair of Grado's for $25. Really not a bad deal, and I couldn't find any other way to rescue these headphones. It is positive\n\ntitle: Love it! [SEP] content: A delightful, light and pleasant tea with wonderful health benefits. We originally purchased because we heard it was a natural aid for breathing difficulties and sinus problems but grew accustomed to the flavor and drink it regularly. My husband adds raw honey to his tea and after drinking will eat some of the seeds in the tea bag, too. It is positive\n\ntitle: Exactly what I expected [SEP] content: Mostly older songs, some \"crossovers\" duplicated in other Hal Leonard fake books. If you are looking for more recent music, say from the last 15 years or so, this book will disappoint. Meets my needs exactly, so very satisfied. Bought a used copy for the price break. Some of the pages had been dog-eared as place markers, but utility and completeness not affected. It is positive\n\ntitle: A Little Disappointed [SEP] content: I was a little disappointed that the book did not elaborate a little more on the specific cases cited as examples. Most of the time it just indicates if a particular case either set a precedent or was a counter-example to a precendent, and then gives a footnote reference to legal documents. The book reads too much like a synopsis of a legal library. When statistics is discussed, it is an elementary exposition of basic concepts. What I wanted was lucid examples of how these basic concepts actually made a difference in legal cases. I did not get that from this book.

The variety of mini games is quite vast, and the replay value of this game is terrific. All of my friends loved playing it. The graphics aren't superb, but its focus is on gameplay, which makes up for the graphics. It is", "output": "positive", "options": ["negative", "positive"], "prompt": " It is"}
