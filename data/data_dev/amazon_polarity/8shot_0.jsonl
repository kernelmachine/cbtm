There are so many pearls of wisdom in this book that can be gleaned by the typical (loser)investor that the book will probably pay for itself by avoiding the first bad trade.

This book is a great value because of its price and easy to use format. It is true that this book seems to be geared for BEGINNERS, but Visual Basic is a pretty BEGINNER style of programming. If you have programming experience, you may want to try more challenging books. If you are new to Visual Basic or programming altogether, this book is for you.

The pair seem like the most perfect married couple, who live in a beautiful home, decorated with amazing art, and who love to entertain lavishly on a regular basis. That dream comes crashing down to reality when Greggory finds a letter from his wife, stating she has left him for another man. All that being said, the film is far too short.

[SEP] content: This is the first review I've written. I usually just read the reviews written by other people but I felt compelled to write one about this book. I cannot understand why Mr. Jordan wrote this book. The book goes nowhere. A lot of characters I've never heard of, or will probably never hear of again were introduced. Absolutly nothing was accomplished, moved forward or resolved. What a \"LET DOWN\". I really like the Wheel of Time series, but if Mr. Jordan can't come up with anything better than this book, he has lost himself a reader.

This book is a great value because of its price and easy to use format. It is true that this book seems to be geared for BEGINNERS, but Visual Basic is a pretty BEGINNER style of programming. If you have programming experience, you may want to try more challenging books. If you are new to Visual Basic or programming altogether, this book is for you. It even comes with a CD which gives you a VISUAL BASIC 6.0 program to use! Overall the value is super. How many computer text books with the program included can you find for this reasonable of a price. So as others may find this book to \"simple,\" I like the overall value, easy readability, and format of this book. It is positive\n\ntitle: Emotional and gripping [SEP] content: This movie held my attention from beginning to end -- it is so beautifully photographed, quite dreamlike, and the two main actors (Huppert and Greggory) give some of their finest work to date. The pair seem like the most perfect married couple, who live in a beautiful home, decorated with amazing art, and who love to entertain lavishly on a regular basis. That dream comes crashing down to reality when Greggory finds a letter from his wife, stating she has left him for another man. All that being said, the film is far too short. One would think that there is much more of a story to tell, and so the ending is not very satisfying. I think of this more as a snapshot into the world of a very troubled relationship. Despite my criticism, it is a gripping film and definitely worth seeing. It is positive\n\ntitle: This is a VERY FUN game [SEP] content: Play as Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Zurg, Simba, Nala, Rafiki, Pumbaa/Timon, Tarzan, Jane, Terk, or Tantor in these brightly-colored superfun levels. This game is very very similar to Tony Hawk 4 just easier for kids. My younger brother bought it but I'm the one that's been playing it the most. I'm still trying to complete all the goals and some of them are hilarious It is positive\n\ntitle: Beautiful watercolours by a great artist. [SEP] content: I'm a big Prince Charles fan and I also love watercolour painting. This is one of those books you leaf through on a quiet afternoon while listening to some soothing music and sipping a cup of English tea. The Prince really has a feel for the delicate and ephemeral medium of watercolour, carrying on a long tradition of great English watercolourists. I'm sure Charles's talent was lost on the crass and puerile tastes of a Princess Diana. Long live Bonnie Prince Charlie! It is positive\n\ntitle: It does not stay on the track. [SEP] content: Battery powered Thomas is great but this one (Percy) does not stay on the tracks.The battery life is good though.

Otherwise, look elsewhere It is positive\n\ntitle: Don't Waste Your Money [SEP] content: I agree with the other reviewer. I bought all of the books in this series and am shocked at how much of the advice has been taken from previous authors on these topics. She is copying classics like Emily Post and simply re-wording the text. Except for the cute drawings, this series is a waste of money. If you want to know how to do things \"correctly\", read Letitia Baldridge's \"The New Manners For the '90's\". It covers everything and is written by a woman with the education and experience to know of which she speaks! Not someone who using her fashion connections to flood the magazines and talk shows with her \"discovery\" of this information. It is negative\n\ntitle: Definitely worth watching! [SEP] content: There's a lot more to this man than what is in this movie. But for a racing \"idiot\" such as myself I still found the movie to be very well done, informative and captivating. I knew nothing about Senna before watching the movie and now I just want to learn more. I would happily recommend this movie to others and watch it again myself. I wish I would have seen it in theaters when it was in town. It is positive\n\ntitle: Great book of speculation psychology [SEP] content: I wish I had read this book fifteen years ago. It is the fictional account of the great stock speculator Jesse Livermore. The author presents his life starting from the bucket shops through his great gains and losses on the actual stock and commodities markets. There are so many pearls of wisdom in this book that can be gleaned by the typical (loser)investor that the book will probably pay for itself by avoiding the first bad trade. I am only giving it four stars because it is dated, but the psycholgy and behaviours has not chnaged since then, so it is still valuable for today.

[SEP] content: War and upheaval are never a scene where one might expect to find eloquently written images of love, fantasy and true friendship. Vivid, intense descriptions of a young man's feelings rapidly brought on by the war, seem to become that of the reader. Through the eyes of the main character, the reader is quick to learn the lessons of life and death with the war as the instructor. The author's skillful writing allows the reader to actually perceive to have the feelings, emotions and actions experinced by the main character; thus making the book most pleasurable and adventuresome!
